/*  In this function, write the name of EXACTLY 12 sponsors that you would like to show in the sponsors marquees in the sponsors section
*   The names should be written as they appear as KEYS in sponsors.json (NOT THE "name" ATTRIBUTE)
*   If you would like more than 12 sponsors then contact me via discord and I'll make the changes
*   (just because you have to mess around with a bunch of style components and it's a faff)
