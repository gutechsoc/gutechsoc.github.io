        <p> You asked. We've delivered!<br>

            After another massive success last semester, GUTS and SoCS are excited to announce that the event will make
            a comeback this year for the second time. Join us at the QMU on 22/02/2024 at 18:30,  for a night of
            drinking, and chatting to your lecturers!<br>

            We will also be holding a raffle this time round where you have the chance to walk away with extra goodies
            (including a signed drawing of the one and only John Williamson ðŸ‘€)!<br>

            Food and one drink token are included in the ticket, so make sure to show up with an empty tummy, and a head
            full of knowledge.</p>
