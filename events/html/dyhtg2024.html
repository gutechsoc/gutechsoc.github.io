        <p>“Do You Have the GUTS?” is the official University of Glasgow hackathon. It puts teams of 5 against each other
            to solve challenges from our industry partners, with prizes being awarded to top finishers for each challenge.
            <br>
            The event hosts several workshops to boost your professional image and sharpen your skills for the upcoming
            internships and spring week programs. You can even chat with the people in charge of these programs and get
            some insider knowledge on what to expect.
            <br>
            If you are new to programming do not fret, there will be several challenges that are beginner-friendly and
            we will run our own "How to Have the GUTS" in order to get you prepared and ready to face the challenges.
            <br>
            Join us in person at the Fraser Building to stand a chance to win your share of £2500 prizes, mingle with
            people in the industry, and free food across the event.
            <br>
            Get your ticket today, assemble a crack team and come prove that you have the GUTS!
