        <p>Come and join GUTSâ€™s big semester one event, the one and only Code Olympics. An online competition for teams
            of up to 5 people, with free t-shirts for those able to collect them on campus and prizes for best coders.
            <br>

            There will be challenges galore, from easy to hard, so everyone can participate and have a good
            (but socially distanced) time with their existing or newly made friends.  <br>

            There will be industrial partners at the event running some of the challenges, so you might even get a
            week or an internship out of it.<br>

            Keep your eyes out for ticket batches to be released soon.</p>
