        <p> What better way to end our freshers week than a public announcement of our first event of the year!<br>

            We have partnered with the School of Computer Science to bring back the Welcome Mixer, open to all students
            of all levels. Your favorite members of staff will also be joining in on the fun, and food and drink will be
