            After its massive success last year, GUTS and SoCS are excited to announce that the Pub Quiz
            will make a comeback this year. Join us at the QMU on 19/11/2024 at 18:30 for a night of trivia,
            chatting to your lecturers, and of course, eating and drinking! <br>

            <!--We will also be holding a raffle this time round where you have the chance to walk away with extra goodies!<br>-->

            Food and one drink token are included in the ticket, so make sure to show up with an empty stomach, and a head
            full of knowledge. Get your ticket <a href="https://fixr.co/event/socs-x-gutechsoc-pub-quiz-2024-tickets-550828976">Here</a></p>
