        <p> What better way to end our freshers week than a public announcement of our first event of the year!<br>

            We have partnered with the School of Computer Science to host a Welcome Mixer, open to all students of all
            levels. Your favorite members of staff will also be joining in on the fun, and food and drink will be
            provided! And did we mention tickets are FREE!<br>

            The event will take place on Wednesday the 27th of September at 7:30pm, in the GUU Debates Chamber.
