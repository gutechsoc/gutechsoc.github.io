        <p>The annual Glasgow University Hackathon is the biggest event hosted by the Glasgow University Tech Society,
            held in collaboration with the School of Computing Science and some of the UK's biggest and most influential
            tech companies. It gives you a chance to do some intense coding while rubbing shoulders with both industry
            and academia, and of course eat free food! <br>
            We kick off the weekend with a variety of challenges being presented: you decide which one to tackle. Don't
            worry if you don't have a team organised in advance, we'll find you one and make sure you feel at home. The
            event is open to students from all disciplines, no coding experience required.<br>
            While sleeping is optional, there will be space provided for participants to sleep overnight so remember and
            bring a sleeping bag. This event is free but tickets are limited and will be issued on a first come first
            served basis, so don't delay. Hope to see you there, and remember it's not what you know before the event that
            counts, it's what you learn while you're there.
        </p>
