        <p>After postponing this event due to the pandemic we are pleased to finally welcome you to our flagship event -
            Do You Have The GUTS? 2021.
            <br>
            This annual University of Glasgow hackathon is the biggest event hosted by the Glasgow University Tech Society
            and is held in collaboration with the School of Computing Science along with some of Glasgow's (and the world's!)
            biggest and most influential tech companies.
            <br>
            So come along for 48 hours of hackathon! Make friends, solve challenges and virtually rub shoulders with both
            industry and academia.
            <br>
            After the success of Code Olympics in October 2020, we will also run this hack using Discord as the main
            platform of communication and we will be posting information there in the run up to the event.
            <br>
            There is no need to have a team ready before you get your tickets, just get one for yourself, then use
            #ðŸ‘‹find-a-team on our Discord server to connect with other participants, or just come to the event and
            find your team there.
        </p>
